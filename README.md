This is my first mod, I just touched blender and Unity for the first time 2 days ago. 
There are some issues in some parts of the model (skirt, hair, etc.) but overall looks good, I'm planning to learn more about skin creation and I
hope to add more characters that I like in the future. 



If you wish to contact me here's my discord: dannyduartemgs 
A newbie like me could use some tips.
